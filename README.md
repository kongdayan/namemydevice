# Chinese Classical Porcelain Name Generator

[Chinese](./README_CN.md)

The Chinese Classical Porcelain Name Generator is a simple script for randomly generating porcelain names with a traditional Chinese style. These names are created by randomly combining different elements from various historical periods, kiln factories, shapes, and glaze colors.

## Features

- Randomly combines different elements (including era names, kiln factories, shapes, glaze colors) to generate porcelain names.
- Allows users to specify the number of porcelain names to generate.
- Returns a list containing the generated porcelain names.

## Installation

This script does not require specific installation steps, just make sure Python (version 3.x) is installed on your system.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the script file to your local machine.

2. Open the terminal (or command prompt), navigate to the directory where the script is located.

3. Run the script:

```sh
python porcelain_name_generator.py
```

4. Follow the prompt to enter the number of porcelain names you want to generate.

```sh
Enter the number of names to generate: 5
```

5. The output will be similar to:

```sh
河清白舍窑青釉橄榄瓶
永嘉南丰窑孔雀绿花口瓶
开耀连江窑釉下五彩天球瓶
开禧容县窑豆青谷仓
成都长治窑青釉褐绿彩多管瓶
 ```
